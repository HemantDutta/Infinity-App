# Infinity: Endless Wallpapers

Hey there wallpaper enthusiasts! Welcome to **Infinity**, the ultimate wallpaper engine that'll keep your screens looking fresh and beautiful. ðŸŒ„

## What's Infinity All About?

Infinity is all about making your wallpaper game strong! It taps into the awesome Pexels.com API to bring you an ever-expanding collection of stunning wallpapers. We're talking about landscapes, cityscapes, cute animals, and everything in between. 

### What I Learned:

While building Infinity, I picked up some cool skills:

- **Infinite Scrolling**: No more clicking through pages and pages of wallpapers. With infinite scrolling, as you reach the end of the page, we magically load more wallpapers for you. It's like a never-ending wallpaper buffet!

- **Responsive Grid Layouts**: Thanks to CSS magic, we've got a responsive grid layout that adjusts beautifully to any screen size. Your wallpapers will always look their best.

- **Search Your Heart Out**: Looking for something specific? No worries, just type in your search query, and we'll find wallpapers that match your mood.
